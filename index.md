I'm currently the Manager of Research Computing at Lehigh University. 

From August 2010 to September 2014, I was a HPC User Services Consultant with HPC@LSU and LONI, helping users with  

 * Building codes on HPC clusters.
 * Install and use of software packages on HPC clusters.
   * Gaussian, GAMESS, NWChem, CPMD, AMBER, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD, AutoDock</li>
 * Troubleshoot problems running jobs on HPC clusters.
 * Provide Training to new and advanced users.
   * Computational Chemistry/Biology, Fortran, Parallel Programming</li>
 * Maintain Grid Services.

 I'm a computational chemist by training with interest in *Ab-Initio* Molcular Dynamics, Spectroscopy, and Scientific Computing. I program in Fortran, bash and tcsh, OpenMP and am currently learning OpenACC. Slides for tutorials presented at weekly trainings and workshops are available on the Training page. The Downloads page contains some LaTeX beamer and powerdot style files that I created for my presentations.
