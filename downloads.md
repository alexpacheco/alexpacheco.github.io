## LaTeX Presentations

I use LaTeX for my documents, presentations and posters. For presentations I almost always use LaTeX Beamer and have tried Powerdot once. I created beamer themes rather than the use the standard themes that come with TeXLive for use at LSU and Lehigh University. 
The themes are based on the official color schemes but are not officially endorsed by either schools. Feel free to use and modify for personal use.
